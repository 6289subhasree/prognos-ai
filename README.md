# AI-Powered Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project presents an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated skin cancer detection and classification from dermoscopic images. The system integrates lesion segmentation, multi-class skin lesion classification, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to support early diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making.

The framework employs DeepLabV3+ for lesion segmentation, EfficientNet-B0 for skin lesion classification, and Grad-CAM for visual interpretation of model predictions. Additional experiments were conducted using ResNet50 and DenseNet121 for performance comparison across multiple benchmark datasets.

This project was developed as part of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) Pune Chapter AI/ML Program.
